    <p>Posted on mar. 28 mars 2017 in <a href="https://allyourbase.utouch.fr/category/bug-bounty.html">Bug bounty</a></p>

<p>I don't do bug bounties due to a lack of time. Although I have a <a class="reference external" href="https://hackerone.com/the-useless-one">HackerOne
profile</a>, you can see that I'm not so
active. However, <a class="reference external" href="https://hackerone.com/myst404">a coworker of mine</a> spends
quite some time on different bug bounty programs.</p>
<p>On 2017-02-06 evening, when we were both connected to our work Jabber server,
he told me that YouPorn had launched their <a class="reference external" href="https://hackerone.com/youporn">bug bounty program on HackerOne</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>him: youporn bug bounty launched today btw</p>
<p>me: on hacker one?</p>
<p>him: yes</p>
<p>me: no time, i'm migrating my DNS servers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was reading documentation on bind, he wrote me back:</p>
<blockquote>
him: oh shit, exploitable XSS in the search bar, can't believe it</blockquote>
<p>Now, things were interesting! I had to hop in. I was also surprised that
nobody had ever found it before. XSS in the search form is the base case.
<span class="strike">I often go to</span> errr, some of my friends often go to YouPorn, and
they've never found such a vulnerability on it before.</p>
<p>Time was of the essence, because we wanted to have a working exploit and report
it before someone else did.</p>
<div class="section" id="from-lack-of-filtering-to-open-redirect">
<h2>From lack of filtering to open redirect</h2>
<p>I fired up my browser and Burp, and sent a request on the search form. I
searched for <code>foobar&quot;</code>. As you can see in the following screenshot,
the search term is output, without any filtering (except for the capitalization)
in a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">meta tag</a>:</p>
<img alt="first_payload.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/first_payload.png" />
<p>However, when we tried to close the meta tag, and open another one, to put
our Javascript payload, we couldn't get it to work:</p>
<img alt="first_fail.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/first_fail.png" />
<p>Disappointed, we still decided to exploit the meta HTML tag. It's a powerful
tag, because it has the <code>http-equiv</code> directive. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_meta_http_equiv.asp">This directive</a> allows
you to define the equivalent of an HTTP header in the HTML code.</p>
<p>The <code>http-equiv</code> directive can take a value of <code>refresh</code>, which
can be used to redirect a user to another page. This kind of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet">open redirect</a>
vulnerability can be very useful in case of a phishing attack:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You send someone a link to <a class="reference external" href="http://youporn.com">http://youporn.com</a>, with your payload;</li>
<li>Your payload redirects them to a site you control, imitating YouPorn's CSS;</li>
<li>You ask them for their credentials, their credit card number, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>We put the following payload to test our vulnerability:</p>
<img alt="second_fail.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/second_fail.png" />
<p>As you can see, there is a slight problem: the dash in <code>http-equiv</code>
is not inserted in the source code. I decided to use some XSS voodoo bypass,
and so, I decided to HTML encode, then URL encode the dash.</p>
<p>A dash, <code>-</code>, HTML-encoded is <code>&amp;#45;</code>, which, URL-encoded, is
<code>%26%2345%3b</code>:</p>
<img alt="first_success.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/first_success.png" />
<p>Boom, we now had a working payload, and were able to redirect users to a
URL of our choosing. Sweet!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="marked-as-duplicate">
<h2>Marked as duplicate</h2>
<p>Just as I had found the correct syntax, my coworker, who had already notified
YouPorn, got the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, this was reported already, <strong>but the original reporter did not
provide a working exploit</strong>.  What I should do is to close it as duplicate,
because the original  bug was already reported. However <strong>I will leave it
open so you have a  chance to provide a working payload</strong>.  Note that the
original ticket was triaged. If you find a working  payload, I will triage
your ticket as well as you managed to go further  in the exploitation.</p>
<p>Thanks and happy hacking</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-open-redirect-to-full-reflective-xss">
<h2>From open redirect to full reflective XSS</h2>
<p>So that was it, somebody had already reported the vulnerability. However,
YouPorn had kindly decided to let the report open, so that we could find a
working payload, and we already had one with the open redirect payload.</p>
<p>But then I thought &quot;Wait a second, maybe I can use the same trick to put
<code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> instead of a dash!&quot;</p>
<p>And indeed, it worked. With the &quot;HTML-encode-then-URL-encode&quot; trick, we could
insert arbitrary Javascript:</p>
<img alt="second_success.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/second_success.png" />
<p>Obligatory pop-up:</p>
<img alt="w00t.png" class="align-center" src="/images/meet-beautiful-xss-in-your-area-a-youporn-bug-bounty-sfw/w00t.png" />
<p>We continued to do some tests afterwards, and we found out something weird
about YouPorn's HTML rendering: no matter how many recursions of HTML-encoding
we did on our payloads, they were still fully decoded server-side. This means
that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code>&amp;lt;</code> became <code>&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>&amp;amp;lt;</code> also became <code>&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>&amp;amp;amp;lt;</code> <strong>also</strong> became <code>&lt;</code></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weird behaviour, but very interesting to bypass some filters!</p>
<p>Anyway, I still have to migrate my DNS servers.</p>
